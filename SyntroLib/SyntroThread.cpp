    \class SyntroThread
    \brief SyntroThread is a lightweight wrapper for threading.
	\inmodule SyntroLib
 
	SyntroThread is a thin wrapper layer that simplifies the use of QThread. It provides a 
	Windows-style message passing queue and associated functions. The 
	normal sequence of events is to create a SyntroThread, perform any external 
	initialization that might be required and then to call resumeThread(). 
	To kill the thread, call emit finished().

	SyntroThread would normally be subclassed to provide customized thread functionality. Apart from 
	standard Qt type functions, initThread() can be used to perform initialization and finishThread()
	can be used to perform clean up before the thread is destroyed.
